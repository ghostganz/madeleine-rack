* Expand Madeleine so that you can pass along an extra context, that's sent as argument
  to every execute(system) ... e.g. execute(system, context)

  the whole madeleine system.

* Pass system seed in somewhere, or be fine with it always being a Hash?

* Some nice integration with Rails for how/when to make snapshots?

* Start writing tests

* Handling Time?

* Minimize bytes written to log for each request

* Update to current version of Rack spec

* Investigate if Thin's async stuff can be supported

* Don't assume env supports dup(), copy the env in a more
  controlled way?
